## Parametric Triggers & Payout Logic

ShieldRide uses **predefined, data-driven triggers** to automatically detect disruptions and execute payouts — eliminating the need for manual claims.

### 1. Environmental Triggers

#### 🌧️ Rainfall Trigger

**Condition:**
- Rainfall intensity ≥ threshold `(mm/hr)`
- Sustained for ≥ `t` hours
- Worker active in the affected zone

**Payout:** `₹150 – ₹300`

**Data Sources:** OpenWeather API, IMD (India Meteorological Department)

---

#### 🌡️ Heat Index Trigger

**Condition:**
- Temperature / heat index ≥ threshold
- Sustained for ≥ `t` hours

**Data Sources:** OpenWeatherMap, Open-Meteo, Tomorrow.io

---

#### 🌫️ Air Quality Trigger (AQI)

**Condition:**
- AQI exceeds threshold (e.g., `"Poor"` or worse)
- Sustained for ≥ `t` hours

**Categories:** `Moderate → Poor → Severe`

**Data Sources:** CPCB (India), OpenWeather AQI API

---

### 2. Platform Triggers

#### ⚠️ Platform Outage Trigger

**Condition:** Platform downtime ≥ 4 hours

**Impact:** Direct income loss → eligible for payout

---

#### ❌ Order Cancellation Trigger

**Condition:** Cancellation rate ≥ threshold

```
Cancellation Rate = Cancelled Orders / Total Orders
```

**Insight:** Indicates demand instability or operational disruption

---

### 3. Inventory / Dark Store Trigger

#### 📦 Low Availability Trigger

**Condition:**
- Dark store acceptance rate ≤ threshold `(%)`
- Sustained for ≥ `t` hours

**Impact:** Reduced order allocation → income disruption

> May trigger **bonus compensation or adjusted payouts**

---

### Trigger Execution Flow

```
1. Signal detected (weather / platform / inventory)
2. Validated via trusted APIs
3. Cross-checked with worker activity
4. Fraud validation applied
5. Instant payout triggered
```

⏱️ **Target payout time: `< 5 minutes`**

**Design Principles:**
- Fully automated (no claims)
- Data-driven and API-verified
- Localized (zone + time-based)
- Fraud-resistant (multi-signal validation)

---

## Dynamic Weekly Premium Model

### AI-Driven Pricing Engine

ShieldRide uses a dynamic, AI-driven pricing engine that recalibrates premiums weekly based on real-time risk exposure and worker behavior.

**Objective:** Design a risk-adjusted, automated weekly premium system that:
- Reflects **real-time income risk**
- Incentivizes **optimal worker behavior**
- Ensures **profitability**
- Integrates **fraud resistance**

---

### Risk Score Formulation

The risk score is computed as a **weighted aggregation** of key environmental and operational factors:

```
R_w = 0.25R + 0.15H + 0.10A + 0.20O + 0.15C
```

| Symbol | Description |
|---|---|
| `R` | Rainfall trigger score |
| `H` | Heat index score |
| `A` | Air Quality Index (AQI) score |
| `O` | Platform outage duration score |
| `C` | Order cancellation rate |

---

### Feature Normalization

Each variable is normalized to a `0–1` scale:

| Variable | Formula |
|---|---|
| Rainfall `(R)` | `R = Actual Rainfall / Threshold Rainfall` |
| Heat Index `(H)` | `H = (Temp - T_safe) / (T_max - T_safe)` |
| Outage `(O)` | `O = Outage Hours / 24` |
| Cancellation Rate `(C)` | `C = Cancelled Orders / Total Orders` |

---

### Premium Calculation

```
P_w = P_base × (1 + α × R_w)
```

| Symbol | Description |
|---|---|
| `P_base` | Fixed weekly base `(₹50 – ₹100)` |
| `α` | Sensitivity factor `(0.5 – 1.5)` |

**Recommended:** `α ≈ 0.7` for balanced responsiveness

> `α` is learned from historical data (rainfall, AQI, outages, cancellations, income loss) to align premiums with real-world risk.
>
> `α = Observed Loss / (P_base × R_w)` — ensures pricing is data-calibrated and adaptive.

---

### Parameter Weighting Strategy

#### Higher-Weight Parameters
- 🌡️ Heat index
- 🌧️ Rainfall intensity
- 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI)
- 📉 Real-time demand volatility

> Directly impact worker productivity and income disruption.

#### Lower-Weight Parameters
- Dark store availability
- Platform stability / minor outages

> Less frequent, platform-controlled, and lower impact compared to environmental risks.

#### Excluded Factors

| Factor | Reason |
|---|---|
| War / Geopolitical disruptions | Highly unpredictable, non-localized, introduces pricing instability |
| Pandemic-scale events | Difficult to model with short-term real-time data |

> These are better handled via **separate catastrophic risk layers**, not core pricing.

---

## Fraud Integration

Fraud risk is embedded directly into pricing.

### Fraud Score

```
F_w = w₁·B + w₂·G + w₃·L
```

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| `B` | Behavioral anomaly score |
| `G` | Geo-spatial inconsistency score |
| `L` | Linkage / identity risk score |
| `w₁, w₂, w₃` | Weights (sum = 1) |

#### Detection Methods

- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection** — ML models on time-series data (earnings, activity, idle time) to flag patterns deviating from a worker's historical behavior
- **GPS & Movement Validation** — Cross-checks continuous location traces with realistic movement patterns to detect spoofed or impossible travel behavior
- **Multi-Account / Device Linkage** — Builds identity graphs using device IDs, IPs, and payment details to identify coordinated fraud

---

### Decision Logic

| Fraud Score | Action |
|---|---|
| `F_w < 0.5` | ✅ Approve |
| `0.5 – 0.8` | ⏳ Re-verify / delay |
| `F_w > 0.8` | 🚫 Block |

**Impact:** Fraud score directly influences premium adjustment and payout approval / restriction.

---

### Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing

#### Threat Model

A coordinated fraud ring exploits the system using:
- GPS spoofing tools
- Off-platform coordination (e.g., Telegram)
- Artificial inactivity to trigger payouts

> Traditional GPS-based validation is insufficient. ShieldRide uses **multi-signal intelligence + adversarial detection**.

#### Core Principle

> **No single signal is trusted in isolation.**
> ShieldRide performs **cross-signal consistency validation** across behavior, location, activity, and network data.

#### Genuine vs Spoofed Worker

| Signal | Genuine Worker | Spoofed Actor |
|---|---|---|
| Movement | Continuous, realistic | Static or unrealistic |
| Delivery Logs | Active, timestamped | No real delivery activity |
| Behavioral History | Consistent patterns | Sudden deviation |
| Network Signals | Normal latency | Anomalous spikes |

#### Multi-Dimensional Data Signals

**Spatial & Sensor:**
- Continuous GPS traces (not static points)
- Movement patterns (speed, trajectory consistency)

**Platform Activity:**
- Order acceptance & completion logs
- Delivery timestamps vs route feasibility
- Idle vs active transitions

**Network & Environment:**
- Network strength fluctuations
- Latency spikes during weather events
- Cell tower triangulation (cross-verification)

**Graph & Coordination:**
- Shared devices / IP / payment methods
- Synchronized inactivity across users
- Clustered trigger events in same region

## Platform Stability Mechanism

To ensure financial sustainability, ShieldRide maintains a dynamic **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)**:

```
CAR = Pool Capital / Total Expected Loss
```

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `CAR < threshold` | Slight premium increase |
| `CAR ≥ threshold` | Keep pricing stable |

**Implementation:** Tracked in database with pool capital balance and historical payouts.

> Acts as a **mini insurance balance sheet**, ensuring liquidity and preventing fund depletion.
