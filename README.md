##  Parametric Triggers & Payout Logic

ShieldRide uses **predefined, data-driven triggers** to automatically detect disruptions and execute payouts — eliminating the need for manual claims.

---

##  1. Environmental Triggers

###  Rainfall Trigger

**Condition:**

* Rainfall intensity ≥ threshold (mm/hr)
* Sustained for ≥ *t* hours
* Worker active in the affected zone

**Payout:** ₹150 – ₹300

**Data Sources:**

* OpenWeather API
* IMD (India Meteorological Department)

---

### Heat Index Trigger

**Condition:**

* Temperature / heat index ≥ threshold
* Sustained for ≥ *t* hours

**Data Sources:**

* OpenWeatherMap
* Open-Meteo
* Tomorrow.io

---

### Air Quality Trigger (AQI)

**Condition:**

* AQI exceeds threshold (e.g., “Poor” or worse)
* Sustained for ≥ *t* hours

**Categories:**

* Moderate → Poor → Severe

**Data Sources:**

* CPCB (India)
* OpenWeather AQI API

---

## 2. Platform Triggers

### Platform Outage Trigger

**Condition:**

* Platform downtime ≥ 4 hours

**Impact:**

* Direct income loss → eligible for payout

---

### Order Cancellation Trigger

**Condition:**

* Cancellation rate ≥ threshold

`Cancellation Rate = Cancelled Orders / Total Orders`

**Insight:**

* Indicates demand instability or operational disruption

---

## 3. Inventory / Dark Store Trigger

### Low Availability Trigger

**Condition:**

* Dark store acceptance rate ≤ threshold (%)
* Sustained for ≥ *t* hours

**Impact:**

* Reduced order allocation → income disruption

> May trigger **bonus compensation or adjusted payouts**

---

## Trigger Execution Flow

1. Signal detected (weather/platform/inventory)
2. Validated via trusted APIs
3. Cross-checked with worker activity
4. Fraud validation applied
5. Instant payout triggered

⏱️ Target payout time: **< 5 minutes**

---

## Design Principles

* Fully automated (no claims)
* Data-driven and API-verified
* Localized (zone + time-based)
* Fraud-resistant (multi-signal validation)

---

# Dynamic Weekly Premium Model

### AI-Driven Pricing Engine for ShieldRide

---

### Objective

Design a **risk-adjusted, automated weekly premium system** that:

* Reflects **real-time income risk**
* Incentivizes **optimal worker behavior**
* Ensures **profitability**
* Integrates **fraud resistance**

---

## Core Pricing Function

## Risk Score Formulation

The risk score is computed as a **weighted aggregation of key environmental and operational factors**:

`R_w = 0.25R + 0.15H + 0.10A + 0.20O + 0.15C`

---

### Variables

| Symbol | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| R      | Rainfall trigger score         |
| H      | Heat index score               |
| A      | Air Quality Index (AQI) score  |
| O      | Platform outage duration score |
| C      | Order cancellation rate        |

---

### Feature Normalization

Each variable is normalized to a 0–1 scale:

* **Rainfall (R)**
  `R = Actual Rainfall / Threshold Rainfall`

* **Heat Index (H)**
  `H = (Temp - T_safe) / (T_max - T_safe)`

* **Outage (O)**
  `O = Outage Hours / 24`

* **Cancellation Rate (C)**
  `C = Cancelled Orders / Total Orders`

---

## Premium Calculation

`P_w = P_base * (1 + α * R_w)`

---

### Parameters

| Symbol | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| P_base | Fixed weekly base (₹50 – ₹100) |
| α      | Sensitivity factor (0.5 – 1.5) |

---

### Interpretation

* Higher **risk score → higher premium**
* α controls how aggressively pricing reacts to risk

> Recommended: `α ≈ 0.7` for balanced responsiveness

α is learned from historical data (rainfall, AQI, outages, cancellations, income loss) to align premiums with real-world risk.

α = Observed Loss / (P_base * R_w) ensures pricing is data-calibrated and adaptive

---

## Key Advantages

* Simple and explainable (no black-box dependency)
* Uses real-time, measurable signals
* Weighted based on impact severity
* Easily adaptable across cities
---

## 🛡️ Fraud Integration

Fraud risk is embedded directly into pricing:

* Behavioral anomaly detection : Uses ML models on time-series data (earnings, activity, idle time) to flag patterns that deviate significantly from a worker’s historical behavior.
* GPS & movement validation : Cross-checks continuous location traces with realistic movement patterns (speed, routes, delivery logs) to detect spoofed or impossible travel behavior.
* Multi-account / device linkage : Builds identity graphs using device IDs, IPs, and payment details to identify multiple accounts or coordinated users operating from shared infrastructure.

### Fraud Score

F_w = w₁·B + w₂·G + w₃·L

Term	Description
B	Behavioral anomaly score
G	Geo-spatial inconsistency score
L	Linkage / identity risk score
w₁, w₂, w₃	Weights (sum = 1)

* High fraud score → **higher premium or payout restriction**

### Decision Logic

F_w < 0.5 → ✅ Approve

0.5 – 0.8 → ⏳ Re-verify / delay

F_w > 0.8 → 🚫 Block

### Impact

Fraud score directly influences: Premium adjustment, Payout approval / restriction

# 🛡️ Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

### Multi-Layer Fraud Resilience for Parametric Insurance

---

## 🚨 Threat Model

A coordinated fraud ring exploits the system using:

* GPS spoofing tools
* Off-platform coordination (e.g., Telegram)
* Artificial inactivity to trigger payouts

> Traditional GPS-based validation is insufficient. ShieldRide uses **multi-signal intelligence + adversarial detection**.

---

## Core Principle

> **No single signal is trusted in isolation.**
> ShieldRide performs **cross-signal consistency validation** across behavior, location, activity, and network data.

---

## 1. Differentiation: Genuine vs Spoofed Worker

Instead of checking *“Is GPS valid?”*, we evaluate:

> **“Do all signals make sense together?”**

### Genuine Worker

* Continuous movement
* Active delivery logs
* Weather-aligned disruptions
* Historical pattern consistency

### Spoofed Actor

* Static or unrealistic movement
* No real delivery activity
* Sudden behavioral deviation
* Matches fraud cluster patterns

---

## 2. Multi-Dimensional Data Signals

### Spatial & Sensor Signals

* Continuous GPS traces (not static points)
* Movement patterns (speed, trajectory consistency)

### Platform Activity Signals

* Order acceptance & completion logs
* Delivery timestamps vs route feasibility
* Idle vs active transitions

### Network & Environment Signals

* Network strength fluctuations
* Latency spikes during weather events
* Cell tower triangulation (cross-verification)

### Graph & Coordination Signals

* Shared devices / IP / payment methods
* Synchronized inactivity across users
* Clustered trigger events in same region

---

## 🏦 Platform Stability Mechanism

To ensure financial sustainability, ShieldRide maintains a dynamic **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)**:

`CAR = PoolCapital / TotalExpectedLoss`

---

### ⚙️ Logic

* If `CAR < threshold` → Slight premium increase
* If `CAR ≥ threshold` → Keep pricing stable

---

### Implementation

* Tracked in database:

  * Pool capital balance
  * Historical payouts

> Acts as a **mini insurance balance sheet**, ensuring liquidity and preventing fund depletion.

---


## Parameter Selection & Model Scope

---

### Excluded High-Uncertainty Factors

Certain macro-level risks such as:

* War / geopolitical disruptions
* Pandemic-scale events

were evaluated but **excluded from the premium calculation**.

**Reason:**

* Highly unpredictable and non-localized
* Difficult to model with short-term, real-time data
* Introduces instability in weekly pricing

> These are better handled via **separate catastrophic risk layers**, not core pricing.

---

### Weighted Parameter Strategy

The model prioritizes **high-frequency, localized, and measurable signals** over indirect or platform-dependent factors.

---

### Higher-Weight Parameters

* 🌡️ Heat index
* 🌧️ Rainfall intensity
* 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI)
* 📉 Real-time demand volatility

> Directly impact worker productivity and income disruption

---

### Lower-Weight Parameters

* Dark store availability
* Platform stability / minor outages

> While relevant, these are:

* Less frequent
* Platform-controlled
* Lower impact compared to environmental risks
